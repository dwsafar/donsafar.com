                                As the Vice President of Operations for a start-up car dealership, I was responsible for building the company infrastructure, hiring, and training employees, implementing new systems and workflows. Through strategic planning and extensive market research, we were able to establish a successful business within a three-year period. Our collaborative efforts with sales, service, and finance teams resulted in improved operations, customer service, and sales revenue. By leveraging data analysis, I was able to pinpoint critical trends and insights, which served as the foundation for our data-driven decision-making process, ultimately driving significant enhancements in business performance. Despite our initial success, we ultimately determined that our profit margins were not sustainable in the long term, and we made the difficult decision to shut down the operation.

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
